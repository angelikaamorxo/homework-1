# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Week 1 Assignment

## User Story
As a marketing agency, I want a codebase that follows accessibility standards so that our own website is optimizes for search engines. 

## Acceptance Criteria
When the source code is viewed, I find semantic elements. 
When I view the structure of the HTML elements, I find they follow a logical structure.
When I view the icon and image elements, I find accessible alt attributes.
When the heading attributes are viewed, they are in sequential order.
When the title element is viewed, it is a concise, descriptive title.

## The Project
The assignment included fixing up code in the html file to make it more semantic. This means changing the div to tags such as header, footer and section. This allows the website to be more accessible for users, giving them a clear understanding of what information is on which section of the website via the code.
